        <h2>Important private number plates information</h2>
        <p>There are certain details to be considered when buying a private number plate. You should first make sure that the number plate you want to buy is compatible with your vehicle. It is not permitted to assign a plate that makes your car appear younger than it actually is. You will need to ensure that your personalised number plate meets DVLA's legal requirements.</p>
        <p>When you buy a number plate from Regtransfers, you will receive the services of a specialist. We will take care of all the formalities and check the relevant details so the purchase of your registration number can be quick and seamless.</p>

                    This means having the number officially transferred to your vehicle in place of its old
                    number. You may not change your registration number by simply buying plastic number plates
                    bearing the number you desire. Without completing the transfer process the registration
                    shown on the V5C registration document will not be changed. It is illegal to display a
                    registration number other than that shown on the vehicle’s V5C.

                        numbers

                <p>
                    Failing to comply with display regulations can result in MOT failure, a fine and permanent

                    permitted to display a registration bearing a year code later than the vehicle’s date of
                    original registration. So, it would not be legal to display a current-style ‘57’ number
                    plate on a vehicle originally registered in 2002. However, displaying a registration that is
                    older than the car - a ‘51’ registration, for example - would be permitted. Please see our

        <h2>Number plate formats</h2>
        <p>The Motor Car Act of 1903 introduced number plates to the UK. Since then, there have been several number plate formats created to accommodate the growing number of vehicles on the road. The scheme started with dateless plates, which did not feature an age identifier. In 1963, the dateless format was replaced by the suffix-style number plates. The prefix format was released in 1983 when suffix combinations ran short. This led to the year character moving to the beginning of the registration number. The current style of number plate has been in place since 2001 and has been designed to be operable until 2050.</p>

                        <p>Car registrations and number plates, including personalised number plates, in the UK, are the responsibility of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, usually known as the DVLA. It issues new registrations twice a year and also maintains the central database that records details of all vehicles licensed to drive on UK roads, along with their keeper and registration information.</p>
                        <p>Regtransfers works closely with DVLA to complete registration transfers as quickly and efficiently as possible. Regtransfers is a DVLA-registered supplier of personal car registrations and number plates and is listed on the DVLA Registrations website. All number plates supplied by Regtransfers comply with DVLA's prescribed standards and regulations.</p>
                        <p>DVLA administers all UK registration transfers and issues updated registration documents when the registration number of a car is changed, or when a registration is removed from a vehicle and placed on a retention document in accordance with the <a href="/number-plate-guides/how-to-retain-a-number-plate" title="Find out how to retain a number plate">DVLA Retention Scheme</a>.</p>
                        <p>DVLA is a registered trade mark of the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency. Regtransfers is not affiliated with the DVLA or DVLA Personalised Registrations. Regtransfers is a recognised reseller of unissued Government stock.</p>

                        <h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom mb-3">Number plate regulations</h2>
                        <p>When a car is on the road, it is an offence to display number plates bearing any number other than the vehicle's officially recorded registration number. If you purchase a private registration, learn <a href="/number-plate-guides/how-to-transfer-private-plates" title="Find out how to transfer private number plates">how to transfer private plates</a> before displaying the new number.</p>
                        <p>All registration number plates displayed on UK vehicles must comply with the <a href="/acrylic-number-plates/number-plates-rules" title="Learn about the rules and regulations">official number plate regulations</a>. DVLA oversees enforcement of number plates display regulations and maintains a register of approved manufacturers and retailers of vehicle number plates.</p>
                        <p>Regtransfers is not part of, and is not formally affiliated with DVLA.</p>
